# ITSP-SRAJAN

This project works as a dual interface in which on one hand it can convert speech to braille while on other hand it can give voice to the static sign language.

The problems faced by the blind and deaf like lip reading, motivated us to find a solution, hence came up with this idea to convert voice to braille and to further ease the mode of communication decided to go the extra mile by conversion of American Sign Language to voice.

Speech recognition library was used to convert voice to text , conversion of text to braille was done using the braille font , using the unicode braille script . 
Further modification was done where tkinter library was used to make this project user friendly by creating python GUI - a user interface .

For action to text we used OpenCV and numpy libraries , and further for text to voice we used text to voice converter library pyttsx3.

Take aways :- This project helped in learning how to track an object, image and video processing and various applications of OpenCV like thresholding,HSV, dilation etc.
It helped in gaining hands on experience on how to create a Graphical User Interface using Tkinter.
